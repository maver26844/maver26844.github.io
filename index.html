        After Maverick Hamrick, a noble adventurer from York Tech, read the book "The House of the Spirits" by Isabelle Alende, he 
		looked at the misdeeds that Esteban had done to the people of Tres Marias, and Mav strived to make something that surpassed 
		Tres Marias to prove he could create something greater. He started by claiming an unnamed and unclaimed mountain as his own, 
		calling it Mt. Hamrick, and recruiting all the people he knows and people they know to help him build a community.
      </p>
	  <p class="text-textSecondary leading-relaxed" style="padding-bottom: 10px">
		One thing Maverick did not want was to be as controlling as Esteban was, so he let the people vote on what they would focus on. 
		The one thing that Maverick used Tres Marias as inspiration for was the jobs. Because the population was so small, everyone was 
		able to work on something, so everyone chose what they worked on in the community, whether it be gathering food, building houses, 
		or being a teacher. Before citizens can work on anything that involves demolishing some form of nature or creating
		a structure of some kind, they must get permission from at least 1/3 of the community to do so.

		The left image below shows a scenic view of the mountainous region. The right image shows Maverick's homestead on the left where he now lives with his family. The house on the right is for his other close relatives.

			The town has a General Shop which has a bunch of general utilities and supplies. There is also the Food Store that has, I bet you 
			couldn't guess it, food. The townspeople don't find a need to make a park when their surroundings are practically a giant park with 
			a plethora of different kinds of nature and wildlife. There is also a caf√©, boasting a decent variety of quality coffee. 
			And finally, in the center of the town lies a fireplace where the town folk gather at night and tell stories and get to know each other.

          There aren't many houses, but for the ones that do exist, they are much like the one shown above. They are particularly made of wood, 
		  contain all the necessary rooms with quality furniture, and a fireplace just to hone in on that cozy feeling of home. The scenic views 
		  of these homes are very eye-opening, being the vast mountains of the region.

          Because the population is small, the local school of Herald Grade School is the only school, and covers every grade level. The school 
		  system itself focuses on getting its citizens prepared for a high ranking job so that they can achieve great things within this little mountain town.
